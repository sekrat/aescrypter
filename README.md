aescrypter is a `Crypter` implementation for [sekrat](https://github.com/sekrat/sekrat) that uses the AES-256-GCM algorithm to encrypt/decrypt the data handed to it.

## Installation ##

```
go get github.com/sekrat/aescrypter
```

## Usage ##

To use this `Crypter` with a `sekrat.Manager`, you do something like this:

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/sekrat/sekrat"
  "github.com/sekrat/aescryptor"
)

func main() {
  warehouse := sekrat.NewMemoryWarehouse()
  crypter := aescrypter.New()

  confidant := sekrat.New(warehouse, crypter)

  // Do more stuff
}
```

Now, when you `confidant.Put(...)` secrets, they will be encrypted pretty strongly.

***NOTE: The encrypted payloads that result from this algorithm are basically made of binary data, so if you're using a storage mechanism that doesn't do well with that sort of thing, it might not be a bad idea to make sure that said storage mechanism either is capable of dealing with binary data or transforms the data to a non-binary format for storage.***
